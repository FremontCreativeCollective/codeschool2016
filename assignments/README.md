# Assignments

This is where you will place all of your assignments.

Each assignment will have its own folder. All of the content for the assignment (code, images, assets, etc) should be housed inside of that folder.

Each project should be its own git repository and uploaded to Github seperately. 

Each project should have:

- A Github repository
- Github Pages enabled (master branch)
- A repo description
- A link to the Github Page
- A README.md file explaining what the goal of the assignment was
