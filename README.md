# Welcome to Code School 2016

This is the master Github repository for all of the content for this course. Since all of the code for all of the weeks lessons and assignments are available, it is possible for you to copy & paste your way to a passing grade. 

If all you want is an A, I'll give it to you and you can leave the class ASAP. If you want to learn to be a web developer, you'll be diligent in your work, type out all of the exercises with me (get the muscle memory in your fingers) and go the extra mile to extend what you know (adding basic CSS to make a page pretty when it isn't expressly required).

## Directory structure

- assets/ | This folder is for shared CSS and JS files that will be used in the lessons and examples. 
- assignments/ | These are the finished projects that we'll be working on throughout the year. These will make up the majority (if not the entirety) of your grade. 
- curriculum/ | These are the daily examples that we'll be walking through. There are folders for each week of the class and the files in the folders should be named after the day of the week that we went over the content. Inside of the week folder, here is also an ASSIGNMENTS.md file that lays out the assignments that we'll be completing over the course of that week, if any.
- resources/ | This is the junk drawer of the repo. Any misc. files or resources that don't belong anywhere else can be placed here.
