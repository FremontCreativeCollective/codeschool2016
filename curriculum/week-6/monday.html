		<h1> NEW MASS EFFECT GAME INCOMING! </h1>
		<p> is an upcoming action role-playing third-person shooter video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Although it shares the universe of the original trilogy, it is not a continuation of it. Mass Effect: Andromeda is the first game in the Mass Effect series to feature an open world environment. The game was officially announced on June 15, 2015, during the Electronic Arts press conference at E3 2015.</p>
