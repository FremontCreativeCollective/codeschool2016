# Curriculum

This is where the learnings will happen. There should be a folder in this directory for every week and the files should be named after the day of the week that they are done.

Teacher's notes and other ramblings will be present. This is meant as reference material. The content of this folder is not meant to be used as a replacement for in-class lecture and examples.
