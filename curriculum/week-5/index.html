	<h1>Leadership Fremont and No School Days</h1>
	<p>On Monday and Wednesday, Scriber-Snyder did not have school. Tuesday, I was present at 8am like we had discussed with the students but they never showed up.</p>

	<p>Thursday I had to be absent due to the half day Leadership Fremont retreat. I sent the students an <a href="https://www.qzzr.com/c/quiz/270408/html-css-quiz">online quiz</a> and instructions on what to do for the day.</p>

	<p>Friday was a normal day. We reviewed Pokecards, worked individually with the students, created Github repos for <a href="https://achotwaves.github.io/Pokecard/">John's</a> and <a href="https://yodayank.github.io/Yugioh/">Dylan's</a> cards and uploaded the files. We also set up Github Pages for the card so we can view them online.</p>
