		Assignment: Variables, Looping and Conditionals

		1. [ ] Use an external javascript file 
		2. [ ] Create variable "noise" and set it equal to "woof"
		3. [ ] Use a for() loop that runs 42 times
		4. [ ] Inside of the for() loop, check to see if "noise" is equal to "woof"
		5. [ ] If noise is equal to woof
			- [ ] write to the screen "It's a dog."
			- [ ] set the "noise" variable equal to "meow"
		6. [ ] If noise is not equal to woof, check to see if "noise" is equal to "meow"
		7. [ ] If "noise" is equal to meow
			- [ ] write to the screen "It's a cat."
			- [ ] set the "noise" variable equal to "woof"
		8. [ ] If "noise" is not woof or meow, print out "No animals here." to the screen

		2 BONUS POINTS
		- [ ] Create a new variable called "times" and set it equal to a prompt that asks the user how many times they want the loop to run
		- [ ] Use the number that the user enters as the limit for the for() loop
